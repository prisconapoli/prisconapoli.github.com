**Simon Ritter explains JVM, GC and adaptive compilation**

<!--more-->

I enjoyed watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/1suzdZssCUE) made by **Simon Ritter**,  a Java Evangelist at Oracle.
The presentation starts with a nice overview of the Java Virtual Machines, and shows the automatic memory management and adaptive compilation impact on latency of applications, including some ideas on how to minimise these affects.

Instead of taking notes in a classical way, I prepared a Mind Map to share. Definitely this is a better way to gather informations, study and do effective presentations.
