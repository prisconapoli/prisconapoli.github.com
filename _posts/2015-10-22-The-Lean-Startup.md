**Mind map: Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything**

<!--more-->

I went through a very interesting article [Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything) written by **Steve Blank**, an associate professor at **Stanford University**. The author describes very well what are the challenges to overcome for a start-up, and introduce the Lean Start-up approach.
