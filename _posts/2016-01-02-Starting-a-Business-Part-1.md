**Mind map: Starting a Business**

<!--more-->

Let's continue to learn about startup and how to run a new business.
I joined some on-line free courses on [Future Learn](https://www.futurelearn.com).

There is a pretty nice series called *Starting a Business* (6 courses). Below the first three:

- [Vision and Opportunity](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/starting-a-business-1)

- [People and Networks](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/starting-a-business-2)

- [Customers and Competitors](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/starting-a-business-3)

and also an interesting course called [Innovation: the World's Greatest](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/the-worlds-greatest-innovations).
