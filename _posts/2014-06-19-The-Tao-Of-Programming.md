</div>

<div style="text-align:center">
<p><i>Something mysterious is formed
<br>
born in the silent void
<br>
waiting alone and unmoving
<br>
it is at once still and yet in constant motion
<br>
It is the source of all programs
<br>
I do not know its name, so
<br>
I will call it the <b>Tao of Programming</b></i></p>.

The highest sounds are hardest to hear. Going forward is a way to retreat. Great talent shows itself late in life. **Even a perfect program still has bugs**.

**Design**: when a program is being tested, it is too late to make design changes

**Coding**: a well-written program is its own Heaven; a poorly-written program is its own Hell

**Maintenance**: though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to be maintained

**Management**: Let the programmers be many and the managers few -- then all will be productive
