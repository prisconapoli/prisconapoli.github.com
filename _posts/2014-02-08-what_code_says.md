**On the power of the rvalues references and the different meanings of *&&* when this is used in template functions**

Probably you have already heard about rref. People describe them as one of the most important new features in C++11. To tell the truth, **Move Semantic** and **Perfect Forwarding** are the real coolest new features. Rrefs are simply the mechanism on which they are built. Before enter in the core of our discussion, let's take a quick look at what **lvalues** and **rvalues** are.
