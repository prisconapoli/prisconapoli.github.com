Packt Publishing firmly believes that *you should be able to **read** and **interact** with your content when you want*, where you want, and how you want – to that end they have been advocates of DRM-free content since their very first eBook was published back in 2004. 

This year, to demonstrate their continuing support for Day Against DRM, Packt is offering all its DRM-free content at $10 for 24 hours only on May 6th – with **[more than 3000 eBooks and 100 Videos available](http://bit.ly/1EPQpjg)** across the publisher’s website [www.packtpub.com](www.packtpub.com), there’s plenty to discover, whatever you’re interested in. 

*"Our top priority at Packt has always been to meet the evolving needs of developers in the most practical way possible, while at the same time protecting the hard work of our authors. **DRM-free** content continues to be instrumental in making that happen, providing the flexibility and freedom that is essential for an efficient and enhanced learning experience. That’s why we’ve been DRM-free from the beginning – we’ll never put limits on the innovation of our users.”* **– Dave Maclean, CEO**

Advocates of Day Against DRM are invited to spread the word and celebrate on May 6th by exploring the full range of DRM-free content at [www.packtpub.com](www.packtpub.com) - all eBooks and Videos will be $10 for 24 hours, including the latest hot titles.
