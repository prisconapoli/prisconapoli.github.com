**A view of Cloud Computing**

<!--more-->

Last week I found a very article titled [A view of Cloud Computing](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rxin/db-papers/cloudcomputing.pdf), published on *Communications of thE ACM* in April 2010. The article has been wrote with the aim to reduce the confusion by clarifying terms, providing simple figures to quantify comparisons between of cloud and conventional computing, and identifying the top technical and non-technical obstacles and opportunities of cloud computing.

#### Cloud Computing: The composite of SaaS and utility computing

#### Refers to:

- applications delivered over the Internet

- Hardware and systems software in data centers that provide these services


#### What Cloud Computing Brings to the Table

- The appearance of infinite computing resources available on demand

- Elimination of up-front commitment/cost by users

- Ability to pay for compute use on a short-term basis and release use as needed

- Economies of scale due to very large data centers

- Higher utilization by multiplexing workloads from different organizations

- Simplify operation and increase utilization via resource virtualization


> “The interesting thing about cloud computing is that we’ve redefined cloud computing to include everything that we already do. I can’t think of anything that isn’t cloud computing with all of these announcements. The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women’s fashion. Maybe I’m an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is it? It’s complete gibberish. It’s insane. When is this idiocy going to stop?” – Larry Ellison, chairman, Oracle

####Top 10 obstacles to and opportunities for growth of cloud computing.

- Availability/business Continuity

- Data Lock-in

- Data Confidentiality and Auditability

- Data Transfer bottlenecks

- Performance Unpredictability

- Scalable Storage

- bugs in Large Distributed Systems

- Scaling Quickly

- Reputation Fate Sharing

10) Software Licensing
