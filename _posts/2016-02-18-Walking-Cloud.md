**A view of Cloud Computing**

<!--more-->

[Google's Spanner](http://research.google.com/archive/spanner.html) is a distributed storage system project that for the first time has solved the issue of externally consistent transactions at global scale. It provides global distribution and replication of data to provide both high availability and to minimize latency of data reads and writes.

> “The interesting thing about cloud computing is that we’ve redefined cloud computing to include everything that we already do. I can’t think of anything that isn’t cloud computing with all of these announcements. The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women’s fashion. Maybe I’m an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is it? It’s complete gibberish. It’s insane. When is this idiocy going to stop?” – Larry Ellison, chairman, Oracle

To get more insights and architecture details, I strongly recommend to read [Google's paper]((http://research.google.com/archive/spanner.html)) and watch this Youtube video [Spanner: Google's Globally-Distributed Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NthK17nbpYs) by Wilson Hsieh
